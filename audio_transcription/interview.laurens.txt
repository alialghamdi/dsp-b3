initial impressions. What were your first impressions of the new web applications compared to like studio?

Speaker 2  0:12  
Well, there's a there's a game that is different, which is nice because it's interactive. And while they both have the paintings, so that's something that is similar

Speaker 1  0:34  
ease of use how easy wasn't to navigate and use the new application?

Unknown Speaker  0:38  
Easy.

Speaker 1  0:42  
Data, AI generated questions enhance your engagement with the artwork? Yes.

Speaker 2  0:50  
Yes. Because then I would read the caption and learn something new.

Speaker 1  0:58  
Comparing new applications with Rec studio, what features do you find different or improved in our new application compared to x studio?

Speaker 2  1:15  
Like I said, the well, the quiz that you can do is nice. Let's see. What is mainly the difference right? So sure,

Speaker 1  1:28  
which platform Do you prefer for exploring art collections and why?

Speaker 2  1:39  
Well, I like it better when it's interactive. So I guess the second one was nice.

Speaker 1  1:46  
Okay, how relevant Did you find the AI generated questions to the artwork and the artist?

Speaker 2  1:54  
And that's very relevant. Because they were just so good to random in my opinion

Speaker 1  2:01  
that the questions help you learn more about the art of the artist?

Speaker 2  2:06  
Yeah, because I think once you get asked the questions and you can remember easier what you read instead of just reading it

Speaker 1  2:15  
what's the difficulty level of the questions appropriate for your knowledge of art? I

Speaker 2  2:20  
have no knowledge of art so yes, but today we're very easy

Speaker 1  2:24  
right? Scoring System motivation? Did the scoring system motivates you to explore more artwork slash artist?

Unknown Speaker  2:33  
Yeah, sure. It would.

Speaker 1  2:37  
Feedback How do you feel about the scoring system wasn't clear how the scores were calculated?

Unknown Speaker  2:43  
You get one point about a question so yeah,

Speaker 1  2:48  
overall satisfactions and improvements satisfaction how overall how satisfied are you with like a I

Speaker 2  2:57  
am satisfied do I have to give a grade one to seven six

Speaker 1  3:05  
improvements what improvements or additional features would you suggest for our application

Unknown Speaker  3:17  
maybe I don't know to be honest, I would have to think about it

Speaker 2  3:35  
when I guess it will be nice if it will be given some feedback about the paint like some story about the painter because I don't know anything about this painter. I just read about the paintings but not the vendor itself.

Speaker 1  3:57  
Are the final thoughts. How likely are you to recommend our application to others

Unknown Speaker  4:04  
recommended if they are going to use resume.

Speaker 1  4:07  
Okay. Any final thoughts or comments about your experience? No. All right. Thanks.
